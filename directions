Our office is located at 201 SE 2nd Avenue, Suite 201, Gainesville, FL, 32601 in the Union Street Station (USS) building.  The office is on the second floor—located above Dragonfly Sushi, 101 Downtown and Starbucks—in downtown Gainesville.  

If you park in the garage across the street from USS, you can take the overpass walkway from the garage to the 2nd floor of USS.  Once you have crossed over to the USS building, we're the first door on the left with the orange lobby.  The door should be open, and once inside, please check in with the receptionist.

If you park on the street, the entrance to USS is next door to Mark's Prime Steakhouse.  Once inside, take the elevators to the 2nd floor, take a left out of the elevators, open the door to the hallway, then take a right down the hall to the balcony.  Once on the balcony, take a right and head to the last door on your right—the office with the orange lobby.  The door should be unlocked, and once inside, please check in with the secretary.
